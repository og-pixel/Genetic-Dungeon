# List of things to keep a track on
- [ ] Add Logger and write information that way 
- [ ] Clean most TODO's
- [ ] Create some sort of "menu" where  I can directly control app better (but still by arguments only)
- [ ] Try to create basic manual corection where we look for rooms of certain size (square stuff or summin)
- [ ] Try to split program into making rooms only
- [ ] Create one map by hand (that looks like dungeon) and run this one as controlled environment 
(also to check whenever I can get something ***Interesting*** out of already made maps) 
- [ ] In report mention, problems with good evaluation
